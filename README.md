# Phishing_Classifier_MLProject
This repository contains a Python notebook for building a phishing classifier using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with evaluation metrics like precision and recall. Ideal for detecting phishing websites, the project is interactive and easy to reproduce.

Features
End-to-End ML Workflow:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering for phishing detection.
Training and evaluation of machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
Performance Metrics: Analyze the model's effectiveness using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Interactive Notebook: All steps are documented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.
Tech Stack
Python Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for machine learning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook phishing_classifier.ipynb
How It Works
The notebook processes a phishing dataset, extracts meaningful features, and trains a classification model to predict whether a URL or website is phishing or legitimate.
